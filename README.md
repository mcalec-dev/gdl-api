# gdl-api

**CONTENT REMOVAL: removals[at]mcalec[dot]dev**

A RESTful API I made for gallery-dl downloads. (it's poorly made)  

Swagger documentation accessible at `/docs`

Make sure to download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Sample `.env` file:

```env
# all values here are imported with config.js
# values with brackets '[]' are converted to json attributes (used for lists)

# set to development to see debugging info
NODE_ENV=production

# will bind all interfaces to this port
# default is 3030
PORT=3030

# name of your site
# default is gdl-api
NAME=gdl-api

# will check if either host is online and use it
HOST=
ALT_HOST=

# the base path that comes after the host
# leave as / if you dont know what to put
BASE_PATH=

# the path where your files are
BASE_DIR=

# never show these dirs
DISALLOWED_DIRS=[]

# never show these files
